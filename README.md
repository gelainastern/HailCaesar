# HailCaesar
This app allows users to type or paste in messages, then encode them or decode them using a Caesar cipher. The user can choose the number by which they would like to offset the message, then quickly encode it or decode it using the touch of a button.

- Uses a picker view that appears and hides when the user taps a text field
- Allows user to paste messages from the iOS clipboard and copy new messages
